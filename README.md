# Eww Window widget generator 
Meant for the Hyprland compositor, this program generates an [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) 
widget displaying open windows, grouped by workspace, and in order of recently used. This utilizes
Eww's powerful `literal` widget which allows dynamic generation of Eww code to make widgets.

This is primarily used apart of my [eww-bar](https://github.com/DMGDy/eww-bar)
setup that utilizes other compiled programs to provide
information to the bar rather than inefficient scripts
